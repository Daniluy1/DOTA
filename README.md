### About  
A competent companion to *Settings -- Video -- Effects Quality* with the main focus on GlanceValue.  
No-Bling<sup>tm</sup> mod is economy-friendly, gracefully disabling particle spam while leaving hats model untouched.  
Might say it even helps differentiate great artistic work, shadowed by the particle effects galore Valve slaps on top.  
  
### Before you ask about VAC:  
Don't worry, this is a perfectly safe, well intended, hats friendly, good behaviour particles-only mod,  
optimally swapping just original files with no content alteration whatsoever, and whitelist-able at a glance...

### DOTA Updates  
- Simply run the builder script again, it will detect any updates and force a refresh - it only takes a minute or two  
- A local cache will be created directly from game files so repeated runs are very fast!  
- New patch detection is generally reliable. If having any issues, select *@refresh* choice to force local cache update  
  
## What about non-Windows OS / issues with the builder batch script?  
Use the pre-made releases in the [BUILDS](https://github.com/No-Bling/DOTA/tree/master/BUILDS) folder via manual install  
  
## How to manually install the .vpk builds after 7.07:  
   Instructions for English language (default)  
   ~ CREATE FOLDER `\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_english%`  
   ~ COPY `pak01_dir.vpk` IN `\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_english%`  
   ~ ADD LAUNCH OPTIONS: `-language english% -textlanguage english +cl_language english`  
   Yes there is a percent sign after `english` as a workaround to keep feed updates  
  
   Instructions for Russian language (same steps for Koreana and Schinese)  
   IF NOT EXISTS `\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_russian\pak01_dir.vpk`  
   ~ COPY `pak01_dir.vpk` IN `\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_russian`  
   IF EXISTS `\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_russian\pak01_dir.vpk`  
   ~ RENAME `pak01_dir.vpk` TO `pak02_dir.vpk`  
   ~ MOVE `pak02_dir.vpk` TO `dota_russian\`  
   ~ ADD LAUNCH OPTION: `-language russian`  
  
   Instructions for German language (same steps for French, Spanish and others)  
   ~ COPY `pak01_dir.vpk` IN `\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_german`  
   ~ ADD LAUNCH OPTION: `-language german`  
  
### How to quickly restore default particle spam DOTA?  
Simply remove / rename the `-language x` launch option and restart the game!  
  
### Hints:  
It's recommended to set Effects Quality option to Low for Potato PC's as it decreases the nr of particles for certain spells  
Before reporting bugs, list particles in game console: `clear;dumpparticlelist | grep [^0\s][\d]*,[\s]flags;condump`  
then share the exported list from: `\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\condump0XX.txt`  
  
### What's new in v7.10:  
~ Fixed unable to run script caused by multiple downloaded copies auto-renamed by windows and default extract (r2)  
~ Bumped version from v2.0 final to match game patch. Mod will use r1, r2 .. for revision numbers.  
~ Faster, more reliable, improved caching, less storage operations, long paths support, auto-install with current language  
~ Press Enter to accept No-Bling choices dialog, integrated endtask choice, clearline working in both Windows 7 and 10  
~ Seasonal category reinstated, as it's still useful for TI7 replays despite event being expired  
~ Extended manual filters to make certain items like arcana's less underwhelming, fix Gyro's call down Valve bug  
~ New Tweaks category - split into subcategories for more fine-tuning - effigies support, proper shrines, filtered portraits  
~ More reliable Dota_LOptions function and consistent verbose output in both Node.js and JScript engines  
~ Add emblem (previously called relic), re-enable expired TI7 Effects for event replays viewing  
  
## What happened in 7.07?  
__Valve removed -LV launch option. Looking at backend code, there might be some internal refactoring.__  
Other client-side modding methods were unaffected, so No-Bling switched to the `-language` method.  
No point on doing resource-compiling if `m_hLowViolenceDef` is unavailable, so that part is dumbed-down to file-replacing.  
Launch options gets complicated as it's language-dependant, unlike convenient, unified, stand-alone `-LV` _( RIP 2017-11-1 )_  
Working test builds using the `-language` method have been updated, while the script was pending a more in-dept rework.  
Months later, no sign of Valve working further on that refactoring - to be expected, really.  
  
## The future  
Integration with the GUI Effects Quality is technically possible. Valve is also slowly extending it to more spells.  
The Low, Med, High options could toggle 3 associated No-Bling choices, right from the Settings menu!  
But after the -LV unwarranted removal, it's better to save energy and keep using dumbed-down file-replacing.  
So you might notice more spewing about particles in the game console - it's safe to ignore.

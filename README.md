### About  
A competent companion to *Settings -- Video -- Effects Quality* with the main focus on GlanceValue.  
No-Bling<sup>tm</sup> mod is economy-friendly, gracefully disabling particle spam while leaving hats model untouched.  
Might say it even helps differentiate great artistic work, shadowed by the particle effects galore Valve slaps on top.  
  
### Before you ask about VAC:  
Don't worry, this is a perfectly safe, well intended, hats friendly, good behaviour particles-only mod,  
optimally swapping just original files with no content alteration whatsoever, and whitelist-able at a glance...

*@refresh is shown only if a new patch is detected or source file is missing; choices are remembered between runs.*  
  
### DOTA Updates  
- Simply run the builder script again, it will detect any updates and force a refresh - it only takes a minute or two  
- A local cache will be created directly from game files so repeated runs are very fast!  
- New patch detection is generally reliable. If having any issues, select *@refresh* choice to force local cache update  

### Troubleshooting builder batch script issues  
~ Right-click and run the script as administrator to overcome `Program Files\Steam` permission issues.  
~ Script generally works on a default Windows 7 install without needing extra libraries but you might be missing some.  
Try to launch manually the Decompiler.exe utility from `tools\ValveResourceFormat` - it should ask for any needed libs.  

## What about non-Windows OS / issues with the builder batch script?  
Use the pre-made releases in the [BUILDS](https://github.com/No-Bling/DOTA/tree/master/BUILDS) folder via manual install  
  
## How to manually install the .vpk builds after 7.07:  
   Instructions for English language (default)  
   ~ CREATE FOLDER `\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_english%`  
   ~ COPY `pak01_dir.vpk` IN `\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_english%`  
   ~ ADD LAUNCH OPTIONS: `-language english% -textlanguage english +cl_language english`  
   Yes there is a percent sign after `english` as a workaround to keep feed updates  
  
   Instructions for Russian language (same steps for Koreana and Schinese)  
   IF NOT EXISTS `\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_russian\pak01_dir.vpk`  
   ~ COPY `pak01_dir.vpk` IN `\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_russian`  
   IF EXISTS `\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_russian\pak01_dir.vpk`  
   ~ RENAME `pak01_dir.vpk` TO `pak02_dir.vpk`  
   ~ MOVE `pak02_dir.vpk` TO `dota_russian\`  
   ~ ADD LAUNCH OPTION: `-language russian`  
  
   Instructions for German language (same steps for French, Spanish and others)  
   ~ COPY `pak01_dir.vpk` IN `\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_german`  
   ~ ADD LAUNCH OPTION: `-language german`  
  
### How to quickly restore default particle spam DOTA?  
Simply remove / rename the `-language x` launch option and restart the game!  
  
### Hints:  
It's recommended to set Effects Quality option to Low for Potato PC's as it decreases the nr of particles for certain spells  
Before reporting bugs, list particles in game console: `clear;dumpparticlelist | grep [^0\s][\d]*,[\s]flags;condump`  
then share the exported list from: `\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\condump0XX.txt`  
  
Question from /u/malistev: __How can I manually allow certain effects, like a Halo on Omni's Crown of Sacred Light?__  
There are several ways to help you add your own manual filters. If you read the code, it supports both item-wide filter (by number = id) and specific particle effects filters. For both it's easier to just run the script once with the __@verbose__ additional choice, as it will generate a log folder with all/most items involved, separated into categories.  
For this inquiry, it would be `-noblingscriptfolder-\log\Wearables\omniknight`. Atm it would contain _Adoring_Wingfall_7580.txt, Paragons_Rebuke_9748_head.txt and Crown_of_Sacred_Light_8958_head.txt_. The number represents the __id__, that you can add in the manual filters section from `No-Bling DOTA mod builder.js` _(beginning of file, there will be a list by hero name with all the manual filters)._ More exactly, add the following line after the _/* OMNIKNIGHT */_ entry (~script line 316):  
`KEEP_ITEM[8958]=0;` _// keep omni halo (number after equal sign does not matter)_  
Since most immortals have multiple effects (not the case here), to keep specific effects you can read the _Crown_of_Sacred_Light_8958_head.txt_ file and look for _"modifier" "particles/ ... .vpcf"_ entries, then add them as specific filters:  
`KEEP['particles/econ/items/omniknight/omni_sacred_light_head/omni_ambient_sacred_light.vpcf']=0;`  
Some stuff won't be available in the log folder because it's not part of items_game.txt, in that case, you identify the particles involved in-game, by demo-ing the respective item, opening in-game console, and list particles in game console as mentioned above under Hints. Also check out `log\no_bling.txt` as it shows some of the logic in categorizing, and the generated build readme.txt.  

### What's new in v7.19:

~ Add emblem (previously called relic), re-enable expired TI7 Effects for event replays viewing  
  
## What happened in 7.07?  
__Valve removed -LV launch option. Looking at backend code, there might be some internal refactoring.__  
Other client-side modding methods were unaffected, so No-Bling switched to the `-language` method.  
No point on doing resource-compiling if `m_hLowViolenceDef` is unavailable, so that part is dumbed-down to file-replacing.  
Launch options gets complicated as it's language-dependant, unlike convenient, unified, stand-alone `-LV` _( RIP 2017-11-1 )_  
Working test builds using the `-language` method have been updated, while the script was pending a more in-dept rework.  
Months later, no sign of Valve working further on that refactoring - to be expected, really.  
  
## The future  
Integration with the GUI Effects Quality is technically possible. Valve is also slowly extending it to more spells.  
The Low, Med, High options could toggle 3 associated No-Bling choices, right from the Settings menu!  
But after the -LV unwarranted removal, it's better to save energy and keep using dumbed-down file-replacing.  
So you might notice more spewing about particles in the game console - it's safe to ignore.

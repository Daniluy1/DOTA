### About  
A competent companion to *Settings -- Video -- Effects Quality* with the main focus on GlanceValue.  
No-Bling<sup>tm</sup> mod is economy-friendly, gracefully disabling particle spam while leaving hats model untouched.  
Might say it even helps differentiate great artistic work, shadowed by the particle effects galore Valve slaps on top.  

#### Before you ask about VAC:  
Don't worry, this is a perfectly safe, well intended, hats friendly, good behaviour cosmetic-only mod,  
optimally swapping just original Valve authored files with no 3^rd party content alteration whatsoever,  
and whitelist-able at a glance...

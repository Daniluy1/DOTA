## About  
A competent companion to *Settings -- Video -- Effects Quality* with the main focus on GlanceValue.  
No-Bling<sup>tm</sup> mod is economy-friendly, gracefully disabling particle spam while leaving hats model untouched.  
Might say it even helps differentiate great artistic work, shadowed by the particle effects galore Valve slaps on top.

*@refresh is shown only if a new patch is detected or source file is missing; choices are remembered between runs.*  
  
## DOTA Updates  
- Simply run the builder script again, it will detect any updates and force a refresh - it only takes a minute or two  
- A local cache will be created directly from game files so repeated runs are very fast!  
- New patch detection is generally reliable. If having any issues, select *@refresh* choice to force local cache update   
  
### Notes:  
It's recommended to set Effects Quality option to Low for potato pc's as it decreases the nr of particles for certain spells  
  
## What happened in 7.07?  
#### Valve removed -LV launch option. Looking at backend code, there might be some internal refactoring.  
Other client-side modding methods were unaffected, so No-Bling switched to the `-language` method.  
No point on doing resource-compiling if `m_hLowViolenceDef` is unavailable, so that part is dumbed-down to file-replacing.  
Launch options gets complicated as it's language-dependant, unlike convenient, unified, stand-alone `-LV` _( RIP 2017-11-1 )_  
Working test builds using the `-language` method have been updated, while the script was pending a more in-dept rework.  
Months later, no sign of Valve working further on that refactoring - to be expected, really. 

## The future
Integration with the GUI Effects Quality is technically possible. Valve is also slowly extending it to more spells.  
The Low, Med, High options could toggle 3 associated No-Bling choices, right from the Settings menu!  
But after the -LV unwarranted removal, it's better to save energy and keep using dumbed-down file-replacing.  
So you might notice more spewing about particles in the game console - it's safe to ignore.

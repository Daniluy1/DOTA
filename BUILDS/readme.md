Providing two pre-compiled builds, one with the __Heroes!__ option enabled and one without.

__Heroes!__ removes some default hero model particles (ex SpiritBreaker blue flames, CK fire, etc.)  
so it might look weird / buggy, hence the option.  

For more fine-tuning, use the ``No-Bling DOTA mod builder.bat`` script!
